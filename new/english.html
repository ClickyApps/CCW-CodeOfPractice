            <b>The Code</b>
            <p>The Code is a list of statements that describe the standards of professional conduct and practice required of those employed in the social care profession in Wales. The Code plays a key part in raising awareness of the standards of conduct and practice that are expected of the profession.</p>
            <p>The Code supersedes the Code of Practice for Social Care Workers published in 2002.</p>
            <p>The Code applies from 1 July 2015.</p>
            <b>The Code and the Register of Social Care Workers</b>
            <p>The Care Council maintains the Register of Social Care Workers (the Register). The Register is a public record that those registered have met the requirements for entry onto the Register and have agreed to abide by the standards set out in the Code.  The Welsh Government determines which groups of workers need to be registered with the Care Council.  The current groups can be found at <a href="www.ccwales.org.uk/registration/">www.ccwales.org.uk/registration/<a>.</p>
            <p>The Care Council will take account of the Code in considering issues of fitness to practise and decisions as to whether a registered worker should remain on the Register, or whether an applicant should be registered.</p>
            <b>The Code and Practice Guidance</b>
            <p>The Code is the primary document setting out the standards for conduct and practice. It also forms part of the wider package of legislation, practice standards and employers’ policies and procedures that social care workers must meet.</p>
            <p>The Care Council may also publish additional Practice Guidance. Practice Guidance is intended as a practical tool, aiding social care workers in their practice and contributing to good outcomes for individuals. The Practice Guidance may also be used to illustrate a potential failure to uphold the standards in the Code. Registrants should ensure they are familiar with the Practice Guidance relevant to their role.</p>
            <b>The Code and the wider Social Care Workforce</b>
            <p>Registered social care workers are required to comply with the Code. However, the Code is also relevant to other social care workers who are not obliged to be registered with the Care Council as it sets clear standards of the conduct and practice expected of the social care profession in Wales.</p>

            <b>Social Care Workers</b> 
            <p>As a social care worker you are responsible for making sure that you work to the standards in the Code. You must ensure that your conduct and practice do not fall below the standards, and that no action or omission on your part harms the well-being of individuals.</p>
            <p>For all of those working in the social care profession, the Code provides criteria to guide your practice and clarity about the standards of conduct that you are expected to meet. You are encouraged to use the Code to examine your own conduct and practice and to look for areas in which you can improve.</p>
            <b>Individuals and the Public</b>
            <p>As an individual receiving care or a member of the public, the Code will help you understand how a social care worker should behave towards you and how employers should help them to do their jobs well.</p>
            <b>Employers</b>
            <p>As an employer of social care workers, you are expected to promote the use of the Code and take account of it in making any decisions about the conduct and practice of your staff.</p>

            <b>Active participation</b>
            <p>A way of working that regards individuals as active partners in their own care rather than passive recipients. Active participation recognises each individual’s right to participate in the activities and relationships of everyday life as independently as possible.</p>
            <b>Carer</b>
            <p>A carer provides unpaid care and / or support and could include family members, partners, neighbours or friends.</p>
            <b>Colleague</b>
            <p>A colleague could be any person that a social care worker practices with directly, or whose work contributes to the well-being of individuals.</p>
            <b>Individual</b>
            <p>The person accessing care, whether a child, young person or adult.</p>
            <b>Person centred working</b>
            <p>Approaches and ways of working that fully recognise the uniqueness of the individual and establish this as the basis for the planning and delivery of care.</p>
            <b>Social care worker</b>
            <p>Any paid worker contributing to the delivery of social care and support.</p>
            <b>Well-being</b>
            <p>Well-being is a broad concept including physical, mental and emotional well-being, protection from abuse and neglect, access to education, training and recreation, support for relationships, having suitable accommodation and securing rights and entitlements.</p>

            Delyth has recently become a social care employer.  She is looking to fill some vacancies within her organisation but is unsure of the best way to design the job advert and conduct the recruitment process. Delyth decides to look at the Code of Professional Practice for Social Care to see how it can be used to highlight high social care standards and values and to assist in the selection of a suitable applicant. As a result Delyth decides to:
			<ul>
				<li>Use key phrases from the Code to write the job description, person specification and job advert. </li>
				<li>Compile an information pack for potential applicants and includes a copy of the leaflet summarizing the Code. </li>
				<li>Work with a resident to include questions for the interview based on the Code. </li>
				<li>Design a case study as a part of the recruitment process on a specific part of the Code, e.g. on promoting independence, confidentiality or team work. </li>
				<li>Include residents in the interview and in assessing the case study. </li>
				<li>Include a team discussion session dedicated to the Code as a part of the successful applicant’s induction plan. </li>

        <p>  Cerys is a first-year social work student. She's keen to keep in touch with her wide circle of friends and let them know how she's getting on in her first year as a social work student. As a member of a social networking site, Cerys posts comments onto the site, including some details of her first practice placement in a residential children's home. She mentions the name of the home and that it caters for 'difficult' children and young people. An individual who meets Cerys during the placement finds the profile and is offended by what she has said. Cerys hears about it from her tutor and immediately removes the contents from the site. She learns more about the privacy options available to users of the site, how to use them and when they might be appropriate. Her tutor encourages her to reflect on her actions and draws her attention to section 2 of the Code, which states you must strive to ‘establish and maintain the trust and confidence of individuals and carers’ and emphasises the importance of ‘respecting confidential information.'</p>

   <p>  Mr Jones is 85 and has severe arthritis, which makes it very difficult for him to move about easily. However, he still wishes to be able to take a bath on his own at the care home where he lives. In addressing his wishes, the care home staff, refer to section 3 of the Code, which states they must 'promote the well-being, voice and control of individuals and carers while supporting them to stay safe.' They therefore carry out a risk assessment and agree safeguards with Mr Jones, including the use of assistive technology to call for help in an emergency.</p>

          <p>  Angela is 18 and has a mental health problem. She is also on strong pain relief medication for her arthritis. She is not supposed to drink alcohol while taking this medication. While attending a live gig, Angela asks her support worker to buy her a beer. The support worker refuses and Angela is angry as she sees this as her choice. Later, the support worker and Angela discuss section 4 of the Code, and in particular the point which says, as a social car worker, ‘you must respect the rights of individuals whilst seeking to ensure that their behaviour does not harm themselves or other people.’ They then discussed their different perspectives.</p>

         <p>   A residential child care worker has been working with one of the teenage residents Hannah for 18 months.  The working relationship between Hannah and the worker is very positive and others working at the home are aware of their close relationship. On returning home after a shift at work, the worker receives a text message from Hannah asking her to call her to talk.  The worker was not aware that any individuals had her personal mobile number as she knows this is against company policy.  Instead of replying to the text, the worker decides to call her manager and informs him of what has happened and that Hannah may need to speak to one of the workers.</p>
<p>This incident leads to a meeting with all staff at the home to discuss issues around Code 5.4 which involves how to form appropriate personal relationships with individuals, their families or carers.</p>

      <p>  Sion, a care home manager is concerned that he has not been offered the opportunity to discuss his training and development needs with the home owner (his employer) since being appointed as manager 12 months ago. The manager therefore requests a specific meeting with the home owner about this and they agree between them the appropriate training and development objectives and how these will be met. This also leads to a useful discussion about strengthening the supervision and appraisal processes for all staff at the home to ensure they are working to the Code of Professional Practice standards that require employers to provide training and development opportunities to enable social care workers to strengthen and develop their skills and knowledge.</p>
