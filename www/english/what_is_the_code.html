				<h1>What is the Code of Professional Practice?</h1>
			</header>
			<div class="content">
				<h2>The Code</h2>
				<p>The Code is a list of statements that describe the standards of professional conduct and practice required of those employed in the social care profession in Wales. The Code plays a key part in raising awareness of the standards of conduct and practice that are expected of the profession.</p>
				<p>The Code supersedes the Code of Practice for Social Care Workers published in 2002.</p>
				<p>The Code applies from 1 July 2015.</p>
				<h2>The Code and the Register of Social Care Workers</h2>
				<p>The Care Council maintains the Register of Social Care Workers (the Register). The Register is a public record that those registered have met the requirements for entry onto the Register and have agreed to abide by the standards set out in the Code.  The Welsh Government determines which groups of workers need to be registered with the Care Council.  The current groups can be found at <a href="http://www.ccwales.org.uk/registration/">www.ccwales.org.uk/registration/<a>.</p>
				<p>The Care Council will take account of the Code in considering issues of fitness to practise and decisions as to whether a registered worker should remain on the Register, or whether an applicant should be registered.</p>
				<h2>The Code and Practice Guidance</h2>
				<p>The Code is the primary document setting out the standards for conduct and practice. It also forms part of the wider package of legislation, practice standards and employersâ€™ policies and procedures that social care workers must meet.</p>
				<p>The Care Council may also publish additional Practice Guidance. Practice Guidance is intended as a practical tool, aiding social care workers in their practice and contributing to good outcomes for individuals. The Practice Guidance may also be used to illustrate a potential failure to uphold the standards in the Code. Registrants should ensure they are familiar with the Practice Guidance relevant to their role.</p>
				<h2>The Code and the wider Social Care Workforce</h2>
				<p>Registered social care workers are required to comply with the Code. However, the Code is also relevant to other social care workers who are not obliged to be registered with the Care Council as it sets clear standards of the conduct and practice expected of the social care profession in Wales.</p>
