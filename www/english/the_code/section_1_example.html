					<p>Delyth has recently become a social care employer.  She is looking to fill some vacancies within her organisation but is unsure of the best way to design the job advert and conduct the recruitment process. Delyth decides to look at the Code of Professional Practice for Social Care to see how it can be used to highlight high social care standards and values and to assist in the selection of a suitable applicant. As a result Delyth decides to:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Use key phrases from the Code to write the job description, person specification and job advert.</li>
						<li>Compile an information pack for potential applicants and includes a copy of the leaflet summarizing the Code.</li>
						<li>Work with a resident to include questions for the interview based on the Code.</li>
						<li>Design a case study as a part of the recruitment process on a specific part of the Code, e.g. on promoting independence, confidentiality or team work.</li>
						<li>Include residents in the interview and in assessing the case study. </li>
						<li>Include a team discussion session dedicated to the Code as a part of the successful applicantâ€™s induction plan.</li>
