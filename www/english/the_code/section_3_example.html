					<p>Mr Jones is 85 and has severe arthritis, which makes it very difficult for him to move about easily. However, he still wishes to be able to take a bath on his own at the care home where he lives. In addressing his wishes, the care home staff, refer to section 3 of the Code, which states they must 'promote the well-being, voice and control of individuals and carers while supporting them to stay safe.' They therefore carry out a risk assessment and agree safeguards with Mr Jones, including the use of assistive technology to call for help in an emergency.</p>
