					<p>Sion, a care home manager is concerned that he has not been offered the opportunity to discuss his training and development needs with the home owner (his employer) since being appointed as manager 12 months ago. The manager therefore requests a specific meeting with the home owner about this and they agree between them the appropriate training and development objectives and how these will be met. This also leads to a useful discussion about strengthening the supervision and appraisal processes for all staff at the home to ensure they are working to the Code of Professional Practice standards that require employers to provide training and development opportunities to enable social care workers to strengthen and develop their skills and knowledge.</p>
