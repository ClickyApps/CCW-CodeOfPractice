					<p>Cerys is a first-year social work student. She's keen to keep in touch with her wide circle of friends and let them know how she's getting on in her first year as a social work student. As a member of a social networking site, Cerys posts comments onto the site, including some details of her first practice placement in a residential children's home. She mentions the name of the home and that it caters for 'difficult' children and young people. An individual who meets Cerys during the placement finds the profile and is offended by what she has said. Cerys hears about it from her tutor and immediately removes the contents from the site. She learns more about the privacy options available to users of the site, how to use them and when they might be appropriate. Her tutor encourages her to reflect on her actions and draws her attention to section 2 of the Code, which states you must strive to ‘establish and maintain the trust and confidence of individuals and carers’ and emphasises the importance of ‘respecting confidential information.'</p>
