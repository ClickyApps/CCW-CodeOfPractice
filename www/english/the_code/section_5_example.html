					<p>A residential child care worker has been working with one of the teenage residents, Hannah, for 18 months.  The working relationship between Hannah and the worker is very positive and others working at the home are aware of their close relationship. On returning home after a shift at work, the worker receives a text message from Hannah asking her to call her to talk.  The worker was not aware that any individuals had her personal mobile number as she knows this is against company policy.  Instead of replying to the text, the worker decides to call her manager and informs him of what has happened and that Hannah may need to speak to one of the workers.</p>
					<p>This incident leads to a meeting with all staff at the home to discuss issues around Code 5.4 which involves how to form appropriate personal relationships with individuals, their families or carers.</p>
