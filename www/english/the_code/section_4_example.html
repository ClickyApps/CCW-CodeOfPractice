					<p>Angela is 18 and has a mental health problem. She is also on strong pain relief medication for her arthritis. She is not supposed to drink alcohol while taking this medication. While attending a live gig, Angela asks her support worker to buy her a beer. The support worker refuses and Angela is angry as she sees this as her choice. Later, the support worker and Angela discuss section 4 of the Code, and in particular the point which says, as a social care worker, ‘you must respect the rights of individuals whilst seeking to ensure that their behaviour does not harm themselves or other people.’ They then discussed their different perspectives.</p>
