				<h2>Social Care Workers</h2>
				<p>As a social care worker you are responsible for making sure that you work to the standards in the Code. You must ensure that your conduct and practice do not fall below the standards, and that no action or omission on your part harms the well-being of individuals.</p>
				<p>For all of those working in the social care profession, the Code provides criteria to guide your practice and clarity about the standards of conduct that you are expected to meet. You are encouraged to use the Code to examine your own conduct and practice and to look for areas in which you can improve.</p>
				<h2>Individuals and the Public</h2>
				<p>As an individual receiving care or a member of the public, the Code will help you understand how a social care worker should behave towards you and how employers should help them to do their jobs well.</p>
				<h2>Employers</h2>
				<p>As an employer of social care workers, you are expected to promote the use of the Code and take account of it in making any decisions about the conduct and practice of your staff.</p>
